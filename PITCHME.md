# Hey There

In order to start your own slideshow:
* Branch off master to a new branch (call it my_branch_name)
* Create a new folder under the repos root directory (call it my_folder_name)
* Add your PITCHME files in there.

The slideshow will then be available on:

https://gitpitch.com/hyfn/hyfn8-watch-and-learn/my_branch_name?p=my_folder_name
