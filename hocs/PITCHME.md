# Higher Order Components (HOCs)

---

### Definition:
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic (alternative for Mixins pattern).

Concretely, a higher-order component is just a React component that wraps another component. It is usually implemented in the form of a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.

A HOC composes the original component (conventionally called the wrapped/composed component) by wrapping it in a container component. A HOC is a pure function with zero side-effects.

We should start using HOCs in our React Apps to abstract common functionalities and reduce code redundancy.
---

### Usage:

* Code reuse, logic abstraction (example: make generic component toggleable)
* State abstraction and manipulation
* Establish Connection to a Store/API Service (perfect for adding logic inside componentDidMount/componentWillMount)
* Control over Inputs passed to the composed component. For example reading, adding, editing and removing the props that are being passed to the wrapped component.
* Intercept Rendering/Component Lifecycle Methods of wrapped component
* Modify CSS of wrapped component

---

### Examples

---

#### Example 1: Establish Connection to a Store/API Service

This stateless functional component does not want to concern itself with any data fetching.

```javascript
const Greeting = ({ name, description }) => {
  if (!name) { return <div>Connecting...</div> }

  return <div>Hi {name}! You are {description}</div>
}
```

---

Our HOC will handle that, and then will send the desired data to the wrapped component via props.

```javascript
const connectMyComponent = ComposedComponent =>
  class extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
      super()
      this.state = { name: "" }
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      // this would fetch or connect to a store
      this.setState({ name: "Michael" })
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <ComposedComponent
          {...this.props}
          name={this.state.name}
        />
      )
    }
  }
```


Then to use the HOC, pass it the `Greeting` component:
```javascript
const ConnectedGreeting = connectMyComponent(Greeting)
<ConnectedGreeting description='awesome' />
```

---

Note that you could also pass in as many arguments as you want to the HOC. For example in order to control how the data gets fetched, and thus make your HOC more reusable.

```javascript
// This function takes a component...
const withSubscription = (WrappedComponent, grabDataFunc) => {
  // ...and returns another component...
  return class extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props)

      this.state = {
        data: grabDataFunc(props)
      };
    }

    render() {
      // ... and renders the wrapped component with the fresh data!
      // Notice that we pass through any additional props
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} data={this.state.data} />
    }
  }
}
```

---

To to use:

```javascript
const BookWithSubscription = withSubscription(< Book />, fetchBookData )
const MagazineWithSubscription = withSubscription(< Magazine />, fetchMagazineData )
const NewspaperWithSubscription = withSubscription(< Newspaper />, fetchNewspaperData )
```

---

#### NOTE: REDUX CONNECT

The redux `connect` method is actually a HOF.
```javascript
connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CreateCampaignForm)
```

It is a function that returns another function.
The returned function is a HOC.
The HOC takes in a component and returns a new component that is connected to the Redux store.

```javascript
hoc = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
connectComponent = hoc(CreateCampaignForm)
```

In other words, connect is a higher-order function that returns a higher-order component!

---

#### Example 2: State Abstraction
We can abstract state by providing **props** and **callbacks** to the wrapped component, very similar to how smart components will deal with dumb components

In the following State Abstraction example we abstract the value and onChange handler of the name input field.

---

```javascript
const enhanceComponent = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class EnhancedComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props)
      this.state = { name: '' }
    }
    onNameChange = (event) =>
      this.setState({ name: event.target.value })

    render() {
      const newProps = {
        name: {
          value: this.state.name,
          onChange: this.onNameChange
        }
      }
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps}/>
    }
  }
}
```

You would use it like this

```javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <input name="user_name" {...this.props.name}/>
  }
}

const EnhancedComponent = enhanceComponent(Example)
<EnhancedComponent additionalProps='some stuff' />
```
---
Something to note.
The last example could have been made a little cleaner using the decorator syntax:

```
@enhanceComponent
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <input name="user_name" {...this.props.name}/>
  }
}
```

Now
```javascript
<Example additionalProps='some stuff' />
```
is the same as:
```javascript
<EnhancedComponent additionalProps='some stuff' />
```
---

#### NOTE: CONTAINER COMPONENTS

You may have noticed similarities between HOCs and the container components pattern.
Container components are part of a strategy of separating responsibility between high-level and low-level concerns.

Containers manage things like subscriptions and state, and pass props to components that handle things like rendering UI.
HOCs use containers as part of their implementation. You can think of HOCs as parameterized (take in arguments) container components.
Basically HOCs are just generic containers, wrapped up in a function (that takes the wrapped component as an argument)

---

#### Example 3: Logic (and state) Abstraction: Make Toggleable

Let's say we want to toggle the `props.children` of a component whenever a user clicks on that component.
Our `Menu` component here does not want to concern itself with any toggle functionality, nor with managing the toggle state.

```javascript
Class Menu extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div onclick={this.props.onclick}>
                <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

---

Our HOC will handle the toggle functionality.

```javascript
const makeToggleable = (Clickable) => {
 return class extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super()
        this.state = { show: false }
    }

    toggle = () => {
        this.setState({ show: !this.state.show })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Clickable
                    {...this.props}
                    onclick={this.toggle}
                />
                {this.state.show && this.props.children}
            </div>
        )
    }
 }
}
```


---

Then to use the HOC, pass it the `Menu` component:

```
const ToggleableMenu = makeToggleable(Menu)

Class MenuList extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <ToggleableMenu title='First Menu'>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Toggleable list item 1</li>
                        <li>Toggleable list item 2</li>
                        <li>Toggleable list item 3</li>
                    </ol>
                </ToggleableMenu>
                <ToggleableMenu title='Second Menu'>
                    <div>Toggleable Div</div>
                </ToggleableMenu>
                <ToggleableMenu title='Third Menu'>
                    <img src="myImage.jpg" alt="Toggleable Image">
                </ToggleableMenu>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

---
Using the decorator syntax:

```
@makeToggleable
Class ToggleableMenu extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div onclick={this.props.onclick}>
                <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

is the same as:
```
Class Menu extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div onclick={this.props.onclick}>
                <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

const ToggleableMenu = makeToggleable(Menu)
```

---

#### Example 4: Wrapping the WrappedComponent with other elements

You can wrap the WrappedComponent with other components and elements for styling, layout or other purposes.
Example: Wrapping for styling purposes

```
const cssHOC = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class StyledComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div style={{display: 'block'}}>
          <WrappedComponent {...this.props}/>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
}
```
---

### Convention

---

* Convention: resist the temptation to modify a componentâ€™s prototype (or otherwise mutate it) inside a HOC. Instead of mutation, HOCs should use composition, by wrapping the input component in a container component.

```
const myHoc = (WrappedComponent) => {
    /// BAD
    WrappedComponent.prototype.componentWillReceiveProps = (nextProps) => {
        ...
    }

    // The fact that we're returning the original input is a hint
    // that it has been mutated.
    return WrappedComponent;
}
```

---

Convention: Pass Unrelated Props Through to the Wrapped Component

```
const myHoc = (WrappedComponent) =>
    class extends React.Component {
        render() {
            // Filter out extra props that are specific to this HOC and shouldn't be
            // passed through
            const { extraProp, ...passThroughProps } = this.props

            // Inject props into the wrapped component.
            // These are usually state values or instance methods.
             const injectedProp = someStateOrInstanceMethod

            // Pass props to wrapped component
             return (
              <WrappedComponent
                  injectedProp={injectedProp}
                 {...passThroughProps}
                />
            )
        }
    }
```

#### Note!

There are three patterns in React that are meant to be used in case that you want to decouple generic logic.

Those patterns are **Render Props, Function as Child, and HOCs**. Each of them has its own uses cases plus pros and cons.

See the [Advanced React Patterns](https://medium.com/@jonatan_salas/advanced-react-patterns-lets-talk-about-render-props-function-as-child-and-hocs-c0cc4b5d6797) link in the resources section for additional information.

### [Caveats](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#caveats)

---
* First and foremost, using HOCs adds a new component to your virtual DOM tree. Be aware of this.
---

* Donâ€™t Use HOCs Inside the render Method

```
render() {
  // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
  // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
  const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
  // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
  return <EnhancedComponent />;
}

```


The problem here isnâ€™t just about performance â€” remounting a component causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost.

Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once. Then, its identity will be consistent across renders. This is usually what you want, anyway.

---

* Static Methods Must Be Copied Over

When you apply a HOC to a component, the original component is wrapped with a container component. That means the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component.

```
// Define a static method
WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function() {/*...*/}
// Now apply a HOC
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);

// The enhanced component has no static method
typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === 'undefined' // true
```

Basically just remember that the component returned from the HOC is DIFFERENT than the wrapped component and so props, refs, and static methods **DO NOT transfer automatically** between wrapped component and its wrapper.
